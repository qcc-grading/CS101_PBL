    We want to make a Class Roster program which save the today's attendance records of CS101 students. To allow a **dynamic** roster, we will use :code:`vector`'s for names of students and their attendance records.

    For the names of students, we use :code:`names` *vector*.

    .. code-block:: c++

        vector<string> names;

    For the today's attendance records, we use
    :code:`attendances` *vector*.

    .. code-block:: c++

        vector<char> attendances;

    Here we use `P` as the presence, `L` as the lateness, `A` as the absence, and `E` as the excuse.
